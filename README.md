<h3 align="center">Docker Port Dashboard for Easy Container Access</h3>

<br>
<br>

**Dockpeek** is a lightweight, self-hosted Docker dashboard that allows you to view and access exposed container ports with a clean, click-to-access interface. It supports both local Docker sockets and remote hosts via `socket-proxy`, making it easy to manage multiple Docker environments from a single place. Additionally, Dockpeek includes **image update checking**, so you can easily see if newer versions of your container images are available.


## Key Features

- **Port Mapping Overview** â€“ Quickly see all running containers and their exposed ports.
- **Click-to-Access URLs** â€“ Open containerized web apps instantly with a single click.
- **Multi-Host Support** â€“ Manage multiple Docker hosts and sockets within one dashboard.
- **Zero Configuration** â€“ Automatically detects running containers with no setup required.
- **Image Update Checking** â€“ Monitor available updates for your container images.
- **Custom Labels Support** â€“ Use `dockpeek.https` to force ports to open as HTTPS and `dockpeek.link` to make container names clickable links.

### Why Use Dockpeek?

Tired of remembering IP addresses and port numbers to access your containerized apps? **Dockpeek** gives you a clean, centralized dashboard with one-click access to any exposed container serviceâ€”whether it's running locally or remotely.

Perfect when you're dealing with many containers across different machines and need to keep track of which images have updates available. Whether you're a developer, a sysadmin, or just managing your home lab, Dockpeek keeps things simple and organized while ensuring your containers stay current.

## ðŸ”§ Installation

### Option 1: Direct Socket Access
```yaml
services:
  dockpeek:
    image: ghcr.io/dockpeek/dockpeek:latest
    container_name: dockpeek
    environment:
      - SECRET_KEY=my_secret_key   # Set secret key
      - USERNAME=admin             # Change default username
      - PASSWORD=admin             # Change default password
    ports:
      - "3420:8000"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    restart: unless-stopped
```

<br>

### Option 2: Using `socket-proxy`


```yaml
services:
  dockpeek:
    image: ghcr.io/dockpeek/dockpeek:latest
    container_name: dockpeek
    environment:
      - SECRET_KEY=my_secret_key   # Set secret key
      - USERNAME=admin             # Change default username
      - PASSWORD=admin             # Change default password
      - DOCKER_HOST=tcp://dockpeek-socket-proxy:2375
    ports:
      - "3420:8000"
    depends_on:
      - dockpeek-socket-proxy
    restart: unless-stopped

  dockpeek-socket-proxy:   # socket-proxy for Docker API
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/socket-proxy:latest
    container_name: dockpeek-socket-proxy
    environment:
      - CONTAINERS=1 
      - IMAGES=1     
      - PING=1       
      - VERSION=1    
      - INFO=1
      - POST=1       # <-- This is needed for "Check for updates" operations
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /run
    ports:
      - "2375:2375"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

###  Add Additional Docker Hosts

You can connect and manage multiple Docker instances from a single dashboard.

> [!TIP]
> The easiest way to do this is by installing a Docker Socket Proxy on each Docker host. This exposes the Docker API via an HTTP port (e.g., 2375), allowing secure and controlled remote access to each instance.

```yaml
    environment:
      # Optional: Add extra Docker hosts by setting these variables.

      # Docker Host 1
      - DOCKER_HOST_1_URL=unix:///var/run/docker.sock    # Docker socket URL
      - DOCKER_HOST_1_NAME=MyServer1                     # Name shown in the UI
      - DOCKER_HOST_1_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=                   # (Optional) public adress; if empty, inferred from URL
      
      # Docker Host 2
      - DOCKER_HOST_2_URL=tcp://192.168.1.168:2375     
      - DOCKER_HOST_2_NAME=Synology                    
      - DOCKER_HOST_2_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=NAS              
      
      # Add more Docker hosts by increasing the number (3, 4, etc.)

```
  
> [!NOTE]
> `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`   Requires mounting the Docker socket `volumes: /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`

## Environment Variables

| Variable                      | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SECRET_KEY`                  | A strong, unique secret.                                                    |
| `USERNAME`                    | Username for Dockpeek login.                                                |
| `PASSWORD`                    | Password for Dockpeek login.                                                |  
| `DOCKER_HOST`                 | URL of the Docker Socket. Can be: <br>- Local socket: `unix:///var/run/docker.sock` <br>- TCP connection: `tcp://host.docker.internal:2375` or direct IP. |
| `DOCKER_HOST_NAME`            | Name shown in the UI ("local" is default)                                   |
| `DOCKER_HOST_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME` | Public hostname or IP for clickable links (optional)                        |

### Additional Docker Hosts
| Variable                      | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DOCKER_HOST_N_URL`           | URL for additional Docker hosts (e.g., `tcp://192.168.1.10:2375`). Must be a directly reachable host; `host.docker.internal` does **not** work. `N` is a numeric identifier (1, 2, 3, etc.). |
| `DOCKER_HOST_N_NAME`          | Name shown in the UI                                                        |
| `DOCKER_HOST_N_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME`| Public hostname or IP for clickable links (optional). If unset, inferred from `DOCKER_HOST_N_URL`. |

> [!NOTE]
> - `DOCKER_HOST` supports both local and TCP connections.  
> - Multi-host variables (`DOCKER_HOST_N_*`) require a directly reachable host; `host.docker.internal` cannot be used.  
> - Make sure the `N` indices match for URL, name, and hostname.

## Labels

Dockpeek supports labels to customize behavior for individual containers. Add these labels in the `labels` section of your `docker-compose.yml`

| Label                        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dockpeek.https=PORTS`        | Comma-separated list of ports that should always open as HTTPS. Example: `dockpeek.https=3001,3002`. Must be added to the container exposing these ports. |
| `dockpeek.link=URL`           | Makes the container name a clickable link pointing to the specified URL. Example: `dockpeek.link=https://example.com`. Useful for reverse proxy setups. Must be added to the container. |

### Example in `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
services:
  myapp:
    image: myapp:latest
    ports:
      - 3001:9000/tcp
      - 3002:9001/tcp
    labels:
      - "dockpeek.https=3001,3002" # Ports 3001 and 3002 will open as HTTPS
      - "dockpeek.link=https://example.com" # Container name becomes a clickable link to this URL
```

<br>

## FAQ

**Q: Can I search for containers by exposed port only?**

 Yes. Dockpeek supports searching using `:port`.

> For example, typing `:8080` will show all containers exposing port `8080`.

<br>

**Q: How does Dockpeek know when to use HTTPS instead of HTTP?**

 Dockpeek automatically treats the following as HTTPS:

* Container port `443/tcp`
* Any exposed port ending with `443` (e.g., `8443`, `9443`)
* Any ports specified via label `dockpeek.https` (e.g., `dockpeek.https=3001,3002`).  
 > Make sure to add the `dockpeek.https` label in the `labels` section of the container in `docker-compose.yml` where these ports are exposed.  
```yaml
    labels:
      - "dockpeek.https=3001,3002"
```

<br>

**Q: Can I make a container name a clickable link?**

Yes, using the new label:

* `dockpeek.link=https://example.com` â€“ the container name becomes a clickable link to the specified URL.  
  > This is especially useful if you use a reverse proxy and want to open your application via its public address.  
```yaml
    labels:
      - "dockpeek.link=https://example.com"
```
